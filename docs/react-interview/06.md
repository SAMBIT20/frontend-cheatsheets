Keys are a unique value that we must pass to the key prop when we are using the .map() function to loop over an element or a component.

If we are mapping over an element, it would look like this:

```jsx
posts.map(post => <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>)
```
Or like this if we are mapping over a component:

```jsx
posts.map(post => <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>)
```
And in both case, we need to add a key that is a unique value, otherwise React will warn us.

Why? Because keys tell React which element or component is which in a list.

Otherwise, if we were to try to change items in this list by inserting more or editing them in some way, React wouldnâ€™t know the order to put them in.

This is because React takes care of all of the business of updating the DOM for us (using a virtual DOM), but keys are necessary for React to update it properly.
