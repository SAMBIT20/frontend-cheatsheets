Redux is probably the most commonly used third-party global state library for React, but you can replace the word "Redux" with any global state library for React.
React context is a way to provide and consume data throughout our application **without using props.**

React context helps us prevent the problem of **"props drilling"**, which is when you are passing data with props through components that don't need it.

Instead, with context we can **consume the data exactly in the component that needs it.**

While we only use Context to get or "read" values globally in our application, Redux and other third-party state libraries **allow us to both read and update state.**

Context is not a replacement for a third-party state library like Redux because **it is not built for state updates.** This is because any time the value provided on Context changes, all of its children will re-render, which can hurt performance.
