JSX is a way of building React user interfaces that uses the simple syntax of HTML, but adds the functionality and dynamic nature of JavaScript.

In short, it is **HTML + JavaScript for structuring our React apps.**

Though JSX looks like HTML, under the hood it is actually **JavaScript function calls.**

If you write a `div` in JSX, it's actually the equivalent of calling `React.createElement().`

We can build our user interfaces by manually calling `React.createElement`, but as we add more elements, it becomes harder and harder to read the structure we have built.

**The browser cannot understand JSX itself,** so we often use a JavaScript compiler called **Babel** to convert what looks like HTML into JavaScript function calls that the browser can understand.

```jsx
...
const [count, setCounter] = useState(0);
const [otherStuffs, setOtherStuffs] = useState(...);
...
const setCount = () => {
   setCounter(count + 1);
   setOtherStuffs(...);
   ...
};
``` -->
