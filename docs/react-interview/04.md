States are values we can read and update in our React components.

Props are **values that are passed to React components and are read only** (they should not be updated).

You can think of props as being similar to arguments for a function that exist outside of our components, while state are values that change over time, but exist and are declared inside our components.

State and props are similar in that changes to them cause the components in which they exist to re-render.
