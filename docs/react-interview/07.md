A ref is a reference to a DOM element in React.

Refs are created with the help of the useRef hook and can be immediately placed in a variable.

This variable is then passed to a given React element (not a component) to get a reference to the underlying DOM element (that is, div, span, and so on).

The element itself and its properties are now available on the .current property of the ref.

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react'

function MyComponent() {
  const ref = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(ref.current) // reference to div element
  }, [])

  return <div ref={ref} />
  conole.log(ref.current) // reference to
}
```
Refs are often referred to as an "escape hatch" to be able to work with a DOM element directly. They allow us to do certain operations that can't be done through React otherwise, such as clearing or focusing an input.
