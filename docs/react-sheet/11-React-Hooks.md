React hooks were introduced in React version 16.8 as a way to easily add reusable, stateful logic to React function components.

Hooks let us use all the features that were previously only available in class components.

Additionally, we can create our own custom hooks that give our app custom functionality.

Many React hooks were added to the core React library as well. We are going to cover the 6 essential hooks you absolutely need to know:

- useState
- useEffect
- useRef
- useContext
- useCallback
- useMemo
