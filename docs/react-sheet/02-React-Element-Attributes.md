# React Element Attributes
Additionally, JSX requires a different syntax for its attributes.

Since JSX is really JavaScript and JavaScript uses a camelcase naming convention (that is, “camelCase”), attributes are written differently than HTML.


The most common example is the `class` attribute, which we write as `className`.

```html
<div className="container"></div>
```
