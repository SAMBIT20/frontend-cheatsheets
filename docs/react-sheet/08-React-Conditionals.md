React components and elements can be conditionally displayed.

One approach is to create a separate return with an if-statement.

```jsx
function App() {
  const isAuthUser = useAuth();

  if (isAuthUser) {
    // if our user is authenticated, let them use the app
    return <AuthApp />;
  }

  // if user is not authenticated, show a different screen
  return <UnAuthApp />;
}
```

If you want to write a conditional within a return statement, however, you must use a conditional that resolves to a value.

To use the ternary operator, wrap the entire conditional in curly braces.

```jsx
function App() {
  const isAuthUser = useAuth();

  return (
    <>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      {isAuthUser ? <AuthApp /> : <UnAuthApp />}
    </>
  );
}
```
