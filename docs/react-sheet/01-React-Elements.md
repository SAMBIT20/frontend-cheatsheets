# React Elements

React elements are written just like regular HTML elements. You can write any valid HTML element in React.

```html
<h1>My Header</h1>
<p>My paragraph> <button>My button</button></p>
```

We write React elements using a feature called JSX.

However, because JSX is really just JavaScript functions (and not HTML), the syntax is a bit different.

Unlike HTML, single-tag elements (like the img element), must be self-closing. They must end in a forward slash /:

```html
<img src="my-image.png" />
<br />
<hr />
```
